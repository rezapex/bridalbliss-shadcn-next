# Responsive Design Checklist for BridalBliss React Application

To ensure all pages, layouts, and components are responsive, styled well, and don't look weird on mobile devices, follow this checklist:

## General Guidelines

1. Use Tailwind CSS responsive classes consistently (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes).
2. Implement a mobile-first approach in all components.
3. Test the application on various devices and screen sizes (320px to 1920px+).
4. Use appropriate meta viewport tags (already implemented in `app/layout.tsx`).

## Layout and Components

1. [ ] Review and adjust the layout of all pages for mobile devices.
2. [ ] Ensure the NavBar component collapses properly on smaller screens.
3. [ ] Check that the Footer component is responsive and doesn't overflow on mobile.
4. [ ] Verify that all buttons and interactive elements are easily tappable (minimum 44x44px touch target).
5. [ ] Ensure form inputs and labels are properly aligned and sized on mobile devices.
6. [ ] Review and adjust spacing between elements for better readability on smaller screens.

## Typography

1. [ ] Verify that all text is readable on mobile devices (minimum 16px font size for body text).
2. [ ] Adjust heading sizes for better hierarchy on smaller screens.
3. [ ] Ensure line heights are appropriate for readability on mobile devices.
4. [ ] Check that long words or URLs don't cause horizontal scrolling.

## Images and Media

1. [ ] Implement responsive images using `next/image` or appropriate CSS techniques.
2. [ ] Ensure images scale properly and maintain aspect ratios on different screen sizes.
3. [ ] Consider using art direction for critical images (different images for mobile and desktop).
4. [ ] Optimize images for faster loading on mobile devices.

## Performance

1. [ ] Minimize the use of large libraries or components that may impact mobile performance.
2. [ ] Implement lazy loading for images and components below the fold.
3. [ ] Use code splitting to reduce initial load time on mobile devices.
4. [ ] Optimize animations for smooth performance on mobile devices.

## Accessibility

1. [ ] Ensure proper color contrast for text and background on all screen sizes.
2. [ ] Verify that focus states are visible and functional on mobile devices.
3. [ ] Implement proper ARIA attributes for custom components and interactions.
4. [ ] Test the application with screen readers on mobile devices.

## Testing

1. [ ] Use browser developer tools to test responsiveness across various device sizes.
2. [ ] Test on actual mobile devices (iOS and Android) to verify real-world performance.
3. [ ] Use tools like Lighthouse to analyze mobile performance and accessibility.
4. [ ] Conduct user testing on mobile devices to gather feedback on usability.

## Specific Components to Review

1. [ ] Hero component: Ensure text and form are properly sized and aligned on mobile.
2. [ ] FeaturedImages component: Verify that images scale appropriately on smaller screens.
3. [ ] PricingGrid component: Adjust layout for better readability on mobile devices.
4. [ ] TestimonialsGrid component: Ensure proper spacing and alignment on mobile.
5. [ ] BlogCard component: Verify that cards stack properly on smaller screens.
