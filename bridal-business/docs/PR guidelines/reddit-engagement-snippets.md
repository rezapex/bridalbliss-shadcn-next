Transparent Reddit Engagement

Creating content designed to appear as organic user engagement, when it's actually promotional, can be considered misleading. 

This practice, often called "astroturfing," is generally frowned upon on Reddit and can damage your brand's reputation if discovered.

Instead, I'd recommend focusing on genuine, transparent engagement:

1. Respond honestly to relevant questions or discussions:
"As someone working on an AI wedding planning tool, I've found that many couples struggle with [specific issue]. Has anyone else experienced this?"

2. Share insights without direct promotion:
"I've been researching wedding planning trends, and it's fascinating how AI is starting to play a role. For example, some tools can now generate personalized timelines and budget suggestions."

3. Ask for feedback:
"Wedding planners and recent newlyweds, I'd love to hear your thoughts. What aspects of wedding planning do you think could benefit most from AI?"

4. Offer help without pushing your product:
"That sounds like a tricky situation. While I can't promote anything specific here, I'd be happy to DM you some resources on AI-assisted planning that might help."

For DMs, keep them brief and focused on being helpful:
