{{BUSINESS_OVERVIEW}}
</business_overview>

Your task is to write {{NUM_SCRIPTS}} script(s) for short-form video ads. Each video should be approximately {{VIDEO_LENGTH}} seconds long. These ads will be used on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts to attract new audience members to the Bridal Bliss community.

When creating your scripts, follow these guidelines:
1. Hook the viewer in the first 3 seconds
2. Focus on one key message or benefit per video
3. Use conversational, engaging language
4. Include a clear call-to-action
5. Incorporate trending sounds, music, or challenges when appropriate
6. Keep the content visually interesting (describe visual elements)
7. Align with Bridal Bliss's mission and target audience

Structure each script as follows:
1. Hook (3 seconds)
2. Main content (10-20 seconds)
3. Call-to-action (2-5 seconds)

For each script, provide:
1. A title that summarizes the main idea
2. The full script, including visual descriptions in [brackets]
3. A brief explanation of how this script aligns with Bridal Bliss's goals and target audience

Output your scripts within <script> tags, numbered sequentially (e.g., <script1>, <script2>, etc.).
