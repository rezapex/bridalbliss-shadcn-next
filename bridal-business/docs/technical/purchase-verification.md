# Purchase Verification and Premium Tool Access

This document outlines the implementation of purchase verification and premium tool access for the Wedding Planning Toolkit.

## Server-side Logic

The server-side logic for purchase verification is implemented in the `/app/api/verify-purchase/route.ts` file. This API route handles POST requests to verify if a user has purchased access to premium tools.

### API Route: `/api/verify-purchase`

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

// Mock database of purchases
const purchaseDatabase = new Set<string>(['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com']);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { email } = await req.json();

  if (!email) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Email is required' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const hasPurchased = purchaseDatabase.has(email);

  return NextResponse.json({ hasPurchased });
}
```

This route:
1. Accepts a POST request with an email in the request body.
2. Checks if the email exists in a mock purchase database.
3. Returns a JSON response indicating whether the user has purchased access.

Note: In a production environment, you should replace the mock database with a real database or integration with your payment provider's API.

## Client-side Implementation

The client-side implementation is in the `/app/toolkit/page.tsx` file. It handles the user interface for verifying purchases and displaying premium tools.

### Key Features:

1. **Email Storage**: The user's email is stored in localStorage for persistence across sessions.
2. **Purchase Verification**: On component mount and when the user submits their email, a request is sent to the `/api/verify-purchase` endpoint to check the purchase status.
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Premium tools are only accessible if the user has verified their purchase.

### Usage:

1. Users enter their email and click "Verify Purchase".
2. The application checks if the email is associated with a purchase.
3. If verified, the user gains access to premium tools.
4. If not verified, the user sees a "Premium Tool" disabled button and an option to purchase.

## Integration with Stripe

The current implementation includes a "Unlock Premium Tools" button that links to a Stripe checkout page. After a successful purchase, you should:

1. Update your purchase database or payment provider's records with the user's email.
2. Implement a webhook to handle successful purchases and update your database accordingly.

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-side Verification**: Always verify purchases on the server-side to prevent client-side tampering.
2. **API Protection**: Implement rate limiting and authentication for your API routes to prevent abuse.
3. **Data Encryption**: Ensure user emails and purchase data are encrypted in transit and at rest.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a real database for storing purchase information.
2. Add user authentication to securely associate purchases with user accounts.
3. Implement Stripe webhook handling for automatic purchase verification.
4. Add error handling and user feedback for failed verifications or API errors.

By following this implementation, you can effectively manage access to premium tools based on user purchases.
